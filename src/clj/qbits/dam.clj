(defn over-limit-basic?
  "Will return whether the count referenced by key has gone over its limit.
   This method uses a fixed schedule where limits are reset at the top of the
   time period.
   On an Intel i7-4770 with 5 clients, you can expect roughly 90k calls/second
   with Redis 2.8.8 (no pipelining, more clients can push this to over 200k
   calls/second).
   Note: you probably want over_limit() or over_limit_sliding() instead.
   Arguments:
       conn - a Redis connection object
       key - a client identification key from which the time-based key will be
             derived
       limit - the number of times that the client can call without going over
               their limit
       duration - how long before we can reset the current request count,
                  defaults to 1 minute (you can pass SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, or
                  DAY for different time spans)"
